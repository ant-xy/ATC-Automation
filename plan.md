# Air Traffic Control Tower System [ATCTS]
    - In the tower, controllers are equipped with technology to support the Visual Flight Rules (VFR) of aircraft departing and approaching terminal areas and other aircraft operational areas.

# Features
    - the program will do the following
        - estimate travel time
        - be able to select aircrafts
        - be able to select airports (to and from), where the approx distance will be displayed
        - approx fuel consumption for the aircraft
        - aircraft approx time to reach in suitable conditions.

# Setup
    - this program will be using the following
        - using APIs, specifically openstreetmaps for getting distance and time approximation.
    - the ATCTS will be a console application, all things will be displayed using text.

# Considerations
    - validate the input
    - validate the output
    - structure for receiving input and showing input should be uniform in all areas.
    - making a console application.
